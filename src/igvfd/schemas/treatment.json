Activation: treatment is known to activate a pathway in the biosample; Agonist: a substance which initiates a physiological response when combined with a receptor. Antagonist: a substance that interferes with or inhibits the physiological action of another Control: treatment is not known to affect the biosample; Differentiation: treatment used for stem cell differentiation pathways; De-differentiation: treatment used to reprogram differentiated cells to stem cells. Perturbation: treatment can cause perturbation in a way that is not activation. Selection: treatment used to affect biosample in a way that can be used to distinguish cells and selected for in the downstream steps. Stimulation: treatment stimulates a cellular pathway."
