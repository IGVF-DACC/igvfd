    "title": "Auxiliary Set",
    "description": "Auxiliary set is a file set that hosts raw data files (e.g. FASTQs) resulting from sequencing of nucleic acids of a sample that are a proxy to some vital information and necessary for the analysis of an associated measurement set. Auxiliary sets usually would not provide any information about the transcriptome or the genome of the sample in question. For example auxiliary sets would include the sequencing of barcodes that correspond to the elements introduced into cells, or sequencing of guide RNA coding sequences in the cells. The files hosted in the auxiliary sets are relevant for the analysis, but they by themselves are not assessing much of the biology of the sample being analyzed.",

Variant sequencing is sequencing data of genomic DNA sequences with variants introduced.",
